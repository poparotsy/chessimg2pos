Usage:
bash
# Start training
python3 train_real_80k_resumable.py

# If Colab disconnects, just run again - it will resume from last completed epoch
python3 train_real_80k_resumable.py


For Colab with Google Drive (based on Gemini's tip):
Add this at the top of your notebook:
python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

# Change checkpoint path to Drive
checkpoint_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/colab_checkpoints/checkpoint_real_80k.pt'


The checkpoint saves everything needed to resume exactly where you left off, so you won't lose progress when Colab kicks you out.
